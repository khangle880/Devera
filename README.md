## AWS Data Stores

# Some confuses

## Why I set username: email in authRepo

Because AWS has 3 options for username which are "username", "email", "phone".
But the sign up function always required username for Login so username is one of them depend on AWS configure
I can't change the rule so yeah that's it.

### Custom Type is suck
AWS won't work, it just generate some "Import" and nothing in there
```dart
// ./model/List.dart
import 'package:amplify_datastore_plugin_interface/amplify_datastore_plugin_interface.dart';
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
```
