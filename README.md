<b>- I have only 3 days to create this project </b>

<b>- So the codes is really mess and lot of bugs </b>

<b>- Worked only on idea flow </b>

### Problems<a name = "problems"></a>

I don't validate any text input, make sure you input carefully your info.

Problems will appear are :

- Wrong email or Password
- Send ICX more than your current ICX
- Unstable internet connection
  (These days I got really bad internet problems which may cause app to crash instantly)
