## AWS Data Stores

### Updated: 24-AUG

I change DB a little bit, old DB is idiot :D

# Some confuses

### Why I set username: email in authRepo

Because AWS has 3 options for username which are "username", "email", "phone".

But the sign up function always required username for Login so username is one of them depend on AWS configure

I can't change the rule so yeah that's it.

### Show Dialog

Show Dialog I use pure "Navigator.push"

Because Provider and Navigator kinda mess up when using inside Dialog

```dart
// ./home/home_view.dart
    onTap: () {
        Navigator.of(context).pop();
        Navigator.of(context).push(
        MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => AddNoteView()));
    }
```

# Some Remind

== <b>In case my future self look back at this not strangle me ðŸ‘¼</b> ==

### Custom Type is suck

AWS generator won't work, it just generate some "Import" and nothing in there

```dart
// ./model/List.dart
import 'package:amplify_datastore_plugin_interface/amplify_datastore_plugin_interface.dart';
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
```

### Show Dialog push to very different Route

I don't know how to use Show Dialog with Provider yet or it can't
